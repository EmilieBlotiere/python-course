      "`Pattern` (see http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern) is a versatile Python software package written by Tom De Smedt from the CLiPS lab at the University of Antwerp (Belgium). This easy-to-use package is distributed over a number of modules that provide functionality for mining information from the web, for processing natural language, as well as for applying Machine Learning and Statistics. Pattern is very similar to a number of other more specialized Python packages, such as the `Natural Language Toolkit` or `NLTK`, which focuses on linguistics (see http://www.nltk.org), `matplotlib` (see http://matplotlib.org/), which allows you to visualize scientific data or `scikit-learn`, which foregrounds techniques for Machine Learning (see http://www.scikit-learn.org).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, what makes `Pattern` unique is its general ease-of-use and its unparalleled web mining module (pattern.web) which make it a very useful starting point for novice programmers. However, if you mean to continue to code in Python, we do recommend that you check these related packages too, since you will quickly find out that these packages might offer functionality that is currently perhaps lacking from Pattern. Note that Pattern still uses Python 2.5+, instead of the more recent Python 3 version we have been working with so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below you will find a series of exercises that you can use to familiarize yourself with the Pattern package. Note, however, that the scope of the package is much broader than the topics we will able to discuss today. You might to store your code for each of these exercices below, since you might need portions of it later again. The package is well-documented online, so please make good use of this documentation while making the exercices! Don't forget to use Python's `help()` function, whenever you are not sure about e.g. what kind of object a new function returns. Happy coding!"

This is a really helpful application (for instance, for an online newspaper that might want to automatically assign the updates in its RSS feeds to one of the paper's main categories, such as sports vs. finance.

Check whether a directory already exists before attempting to create it. When you inspect the text files in the original 20_newsgroups directories you will notice that they still contain meta-information that you don't want to include as actual text data in the classification task. Write a function to automatically remove this meta-information (up to the line starting with \"Lines:\" etc.) and do not include files that after cleaning them up contain less than 10 words. Write the clean result (i.e. containing only the actual text) to a new file under the appropriate new \".clean\"-directory. Append the extension \".clean.txt\" to the original file name.

Next, you train a classifier on the n-1 remaining training documents in your collection and then you have the newly trained machine learner classifiy the single, held-out item. You repeat this process for each item in your document set (i.e. n times) and each you store the classification result (correct or not correct). At the end of the ride, you can calculate the overall accuracy of your intelligent system (the number of correct applications divided by n): the value gives you a good idea of the generalization performance of your classifier, i.e. an idea of how well the classifier would perform if you would present it with a new, unknown item.\n",
